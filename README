Welcome to Bubbenstein/SDL (aka BSDL)!

----- FEATURES -----

1) Support for multiple platforms, including Windows and Linux (it's probably possible to compile the engine for MacOS X too without any modification, but I cannot test this)

2) 24-bit graphics at 640x480 resolution

3) Accurate grid-based collision detection

4) A complex heightmap world format (stairs, platforms, windows, and buildings are all possible constructions)

5) Scaling sprites of any shape and size

6) Wall, floor, and ceiling textures (dimensions must be a power of 2)

7) Depth based lighting effects

8) A complex entity subsystem for in-game objects, particles, and actors

9) A direction and position based sound system using the SDL_mixer library

I personally have a makeshift world editor to make game maps, but the interface is nasty, the code is ugly, and the thingy can only be built on Linux. I'd be willing to pass any interested person some builds/code if they really wanted it, but to tell the truth, I'd be far more interested if said person were willing to work with me to build a new set of tools from scratch. :)

----- HOW TO USE -----

The core engine is still in a basic state right now. If you start it up without any arguments, it will load "testmap.bsm". You can pass other filenames to the engine to have it load different maps. This is possible both at the command line and by dragging and dropping the map files to the engine in Windows.

Here are the controls for the game:

Escape			-	Close the program
W, A, S, D		-	Move forward, left, backwards, and right, respectively
Shift			-	Speed movement modifier
Alt				-	Strafe movement modifier
Space			-	Jump key
Mouse			-	Look up, down, left, and right
Mouse Button 0		-	Attack
F6				-	Throw a screenshot to the "shots" folder
N				-	Activates "noclip" as long as the key is pressed
P				-	Suspends the camera as long as the key is pressed
I				-	Spawn an actor
K				-	Report the player's position
G				-	Genocide troopers
0-9				-	Select weapon
B				-	Test sound effect
M				-	Toggle music
